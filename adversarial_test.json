It refers to a death that occurs when a person engages in an act that causes self-harm, without intending or realizing its potential fatality. The paper reviews the current literature on accidental suicide, including its definition, epidemiology, etiology, and implications for prevention.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that accidental suicide accounts for about 1% of all suicides worldwide, but the actual number may be higher due to underreporting, misclassification, or lack of information. Accidental suicide can result from various scenarios, such as drug or alcohol misuse, risky or impulsive behaviors, self-harm attempts with non-lethal intentions, imitation or experimentation with suicidal methods, and autoerotic asphyxiation.\n\nThe risk factors for accidental suicide are complex and multifaceted. They include individual factors (such as mental health problems, personality traits, impulsivity, low self-esteem), interpersonal factors (such as social isolation, relationship conflicts, peer influence), environmental factors (such as availability of lethal means, exposure to media or online content), and situational factors (such as stressful life events, emotional distress).\n\nPrevention strategies for accidental suicide require a comprehensive and coordinated approach involving multiple stakeholders and sectors. Some evidence-based interventions include promoting safe storage and disposal of drugs and firearms, enhancing access to mental health care and crisis support, educating parents and teachers about warning signs and referral options, raising awareness and reducing stigma about suicidal behaviors, implementing school-based programs to foster coping skills and resilience, regulating and monitoring media portrayals of suicide, providing guidance and training for professionals who work with high-risk groups, and developing protocols for postvention and bereavement support.\n\nAccidental suicide is a preventable cause of death that requires attention and action from researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and communities.
